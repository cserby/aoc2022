# Notes

Gave up on part2, I get too low results, but I don't see why :(

UPDATE: Fixed part2. The problem was that the blob was touching the field's edges
thus steam couldn't fill those parts. I also seem to have had some issue with the
filling logic, so I hacked around the issue by performing the fill multiple times.
